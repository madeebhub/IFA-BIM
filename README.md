# IFA-BIM
I have developed a personal website for IFA Design and BIM Consultants, a growing UAE-based architecture and BIM consultancy. The company specializes in Building Information Modeling (BIM), digital transformation, and architecture consultancy, offering efficient, sustainable, and advanced solutions for the AEC (architecture, engineering, and construction) industry. With strong expertise in Revit/BIM implementation, automation, and multi-disciplinary coordination, IFA ensures smooth project execution from design to facility management.

In this website project, I focused on creating a user-friendly design to provide a smooth and convenient experience for visitors. I also successfully integrated an AI chatbot powered by Google Gemini to enhance user interaction and support. This project reflects both the companyâ€™s modern digital approach and my focus on delivering clean, smart web solutions.
